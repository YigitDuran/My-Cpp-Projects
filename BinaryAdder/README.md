# BinaryAdder

**Description:**

This C++ program takes two binary sequences as input from the user, converts them to decimal integers, calculates their sum, and then converts the sum back into a binary representation. The program provides error handling to ensure that the user inputs valid binary digits (0 or 1).

**Features:**

* User-friendly input prompts.
* Robust error handling for invalid inputs.
* Accurate conversion between binary and decimal representations.
* Clear output displaying the decimal sum and its binary equivalent.

**How to Use:**

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ BinaryAdder.cpp -o BinaryAdder`).
2. Run the compiled executable (e.g., `./BinaryAdder`).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the length and digits of your two binary sequences.
4. The program will display the decimal sum and the corresponding binary representation.

**Note:**

* This program assumes the user will enter valid integer values for the number of digits and individual binary digits.
* Error handling is implemented to prevent invalid inputs (e.g., negative digit counts or non-binary digits).
