# BitCounter

**Description:**

This C++ program determines the minimum number of bits required to represent a given integer in binary form. It achieves this using bitwise operations, making it efficient for analyzing the binary structure of integers.

**Functionality:**

* Prompts the user to enter an integer.
* Calculates the number of bits needed to represent the integer in binary.
* Prints the result to the console.

**How to Use:**

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ BitCounter.cpp -o BitCounter`).
2. Run the compiled executable (e.g., `./BitCounter`).
3. Enter the integer you want to analyze when prompted.
4. The program will display the minimum number of bits required.
