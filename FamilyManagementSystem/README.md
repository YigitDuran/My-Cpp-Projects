# FamilyManagementSystem

**Description:**

This C++ project models families and their members using two classes: `person` and `family`. It calculates the "kindergeld" (child benefit) a family is entitled to based on the number of children.

**Classes:**

*   **`person`:**
    *   Represents an individual with a name, surname, and age.
    *   Provides constructors (default and parameterized) to initialize a person's details.
    *   Includes a `print` method to display information about the person.
*   **`family`:**
    *   Represents a family unit with a `member` (of type `person`) and `number_of_children`.
    *   Calculates `kindergeld` based on German child benefit rules.
    *   Provides constructors (default and parameterized) to initialize a family.
    *   Includes a `print` method to display family details, including the member's information and the calculated `kindergeld`.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Compile:** `g++ *.cpp -o FamilyManagementSystem`
2.  **Run:** `./FamilyManagementSystem`
3.  **Output:** The program will create example `person` and `family` objects and print their details, including the calculated kindergeld.

**Example Output:**

p1:
name:            nothing
surname:          nothing
age:             0

 father:
name:            jack
surname:          daniels
age:             34

 f1:
name:            nothing
surname:          nothing
age:             0
Number of children: 0
Kindergeld:        0

 f2:
name:            jack
surname:          daniels
age:             34
Number of children: 5
Kindergeld:        949

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**

*   **Classes and Objects:** Creation and usage of classes to model real-world entities.
*   **Constructors:** Initialization of objects with default values or provided parameters.
*   **`std::move` Semantics:**  (Used but could be potentially optimized) Efficient transfer of string ownership in some constructors.
*   **`const` Correctness:**  Using `const` references for parameters and `const` member functions where appropriate.
*   **Calculation Logic:** Implementation of the German kindergeld calculation rules.
*   **Member Functions:**  Methods to display object information (`print`) and calculate kindergeld (`getKindergeld`).

**Potential Improvements:**

*   **Input Validation:** Add checks for valid age and number of children.
*   **Error Handling:** Throw exceptions or provide more informative error messages for invalid inputs.
*   **Flexible Kindergeld Rules:** Make the kindergeld calculation customizable to adapt to different rules or regions.
